Variant.cpp has been modified to allow more pins to be used as interrupts in MKRZero_Firmware.ino. This file belongs in: 

Windows: C:\Users\Gavin Remme\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\samd\1.8.6\variants\mkrzero

Linux: TBD

When the Arduino "core'/main application is updated, this file will most likely be overwritten, and needs to be copied back. The pins that the 10 ultrasonic sensors use can be found in MKRZero_Firmware.ino.
